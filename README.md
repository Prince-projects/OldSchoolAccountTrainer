# OldSchoolAccountTrainer
An AIO script for Dreambot. Created with the end goal of being capable of training a fresh f2p account to max given enough time.


This is primarily an avenue to demonstrate coding experience. I need to add the following learned topics:

- Factory patterns for object creation in the task allocation system.
- Threading to create async program
- Use of java timers.
- Derived classes.
- Move all methods into their own classes for org's sake.
